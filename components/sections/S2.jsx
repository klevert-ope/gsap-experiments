          In the world of transportation, flying cars had transitioned from
          science fiction to reality. Cities had sprawling networks of automated
          aerial taxis, eliminating traffic congestion and significantly
          reducing pollution. Electric and self-driving vehicles had become the
          norm, making accidents a rarity. The streets were quieter, and the air
          was cleaner.

          Education had transformed as well. Traditional classrooms were a thing
          of the past. Students now entered virtual reality environments where
          they could explore history, travel to different eras, and interact
          with historical figures. Learning was not confined by location or
          time, making quality education accessible to all, regardless of their
          circumstances.
